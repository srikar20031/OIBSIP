I developed 2 projects in java.
these are the projects:
1) Number guessing game: basically,in this computer generates a number randomly between 1-100 and gives you 10 chances to guess the number and it has a score system which displays the score after completion of game
 -> to play this game open your command prompt(windows +r,and enter cmd) and save the folder.
 -> copy the path of folder and type cd "paste the path".
 -> type the following commands:
    javac GuessTheNumber.java
    java GuessTheNumber
    
    -> you can play the game
    
 2) atm interface: this gives you a basic interface demo of atm while banking operations
 -> to play this game open your command prompt(windows +r,and enter cmd) and save the folder.
 -> copy the path of folder and type cd "paste the path".
 -> type the following commands:
    javac ATM.java
    java ATM
